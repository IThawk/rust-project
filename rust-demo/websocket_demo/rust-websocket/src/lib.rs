//! Rust-WebSocket is a WebSocket (RFC6455) library written in Rust.
//!
//! # Synchronous and Asynchronous
//! This crate has both async and sync implementations of websockets, you are free to
//! choose which one you would like to use by switching on the `async` or `sync` features
//! for this crate. By default both are switched on since they do not conflict with each
//! other.
//!
//! You'll find many modules with `::sync` and `::async` submodules that separate these
//! behaviours. Since it get's tedious to add these on when appropriate a top-level
//! convenience module called `websocket::sync` and `websocket::async` has been added that
//! groups all the sync and async stuff, respectively.
//!
//! # Clients
//! To make a client use the `ClientBuilder` struct, this builder has methods
//! for creating both synchronous and asynchronous clients.
//!
//! # Servers
//! WebSocket servers act similarly to the `TcpListener`, and listen for connections.
//! See the `Server` struct documentation for more information. The `bind()` and
//! `bind_secure()` functions will bind the server to the given `SocketAddr`.
//!
//! # Extending Rust-WebSocket
//! The `ws` module contains the traits and functions used by Rust-WebSocket at a lower
//! level. Their usage is explained in the module documentation.
